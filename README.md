## Description

The starter project had some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. The project was converted from a static project to an interactive one. The HTML and CSS files were modified, but primarily the JavaScript file.
The project allows to add more sections to the page and dynamically create a navigation bar at the top of the page using JavaScript.
While the user is scrolling the page, the active navigation button is highlighted showing the currently displayed section.

## Author

The code was written by Agata Latos based on the starter provided in Udacity's Nanodegree Program.
